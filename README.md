# Operating-Systems-Paging-Simulation

By Jason Yao [github](https://www.github.com/JasonYao/Operating-Systems-Paging-Simulation) <-- instructions are prettier when you read it here

## Instructions for the grader

### Compilation & execution (the easy way)

`./compileAndTest` # Ain't life just so nice and easy when this stuff is abstracted away?

To change the input that you'd like to run, simply edit the [compile script](compileAndTest.sh):

`testNumber="<test_number>"`, where `<test_number>` is an integer between 01 and 16 inclusive. NOTE: for values between 01 & 09,
make sure to remember to put a `0` in front of the variable string (GOOD: testNumber="08", BAD: testNumber="8")

A note about debugging flags:

The compile and test script will automatically send in the show random and show verbose mode flags. To change either, please go to the 
[change input flags section](#change-input-flags)

### Compilation & execution (the sad and lonely way)

Why would you do this when my awesome build script is so much better? :(

`mkdir output` # Creates a directory for the compiled .class files

`javac src/*.java -d output` # Compiles the java source files

`java -cp output Lab4 --show-random testing/input/input-<test_number>` e.g. `java -cp output Lab4 --show-random testing/input/input-01` # Runs the java program

To quickly take a look at the standardised output, simply run `cat testing/input/input-<test_number>` e.g. `cat testing/output/output-01`

## Description

This repo is to show an understanding of operating-systems level demand paging, by simulating pagination, and showing the effects of the page size,
the  program size, the page replacement algorithm type, and the input job mix, and the effect they all have on the amount of page faults generated by the simulator.

## Detailed instructions

### change-input-flags

To alter the --show-random flag, simply edit the [compile script](compileAndTest.sh) such that the line:

`java -cp output Lab4 --show-random $input` is changed to: `java -cp output Lab4 $input`.

To alter the show debug mode flag (the thing that shows what's going on every time cycle), you'll have to do a bit more work:

Open up the testing file that you'd like to use, and then edit the last digit to be 0.

e.g. for [input-01](testing/input/input-01):

Original: `10 10 20 1 10 lru 1`

Without debug flag: `10 10 20 1 10 lru 0`
